                <br>
                <p>Hi! My name is Brittany and I'm a software developer located in the Raleigh Durham area. I was a music educator for 10 years prior to my decision to make the jump into the tech industry, and am passionate about creating software and web applications that benefit educators. I really enjoy using the artistic side of my brain to develop eye-catching front end UI's, and the mathematical side of my brain to work on backend logistics.</p>
                <br>
                <p> When I'm not coding, some of my hobbies include playing piano, crocheting, reading, baking, and exploring the local area. I also have 3 cute cats that serve as my coding support team!</p>
