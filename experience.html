            I build, test, and optimize high-converting landing pages using
            Unbounce.com, implementing data-driven A/B experiments to enhance
            client campaign performance. By leveraging HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, I develop responsive, user-focused web designs that
            align with marketing goals and brand guidelines. Additionally, I
            utilize Convert.com for advanced A/B testing and experiment tracking
            to refine page layouts, calls-to-action, and user flows, driving
            higher engagement. I also collaborate cross-functionally with
            designers and marketing strategists to troubleshoot issues and
            ensure seamless execution of campaign initiatives.

            I collaborated with a cross-functional team to design and implement innovative AI solutions, applying prompt engineering techniques and integrating multiple large language models (LLMs) into project workflows. Additionally, I developed high-performance Python backend APIs to support project functionality, improve system efficiency, and ensure seamless interaction between AI components and user-facing features.

            I collaborated with a team of five to organize and lead large group functions, frequently adapting to changes in curriculum to meet evolving educational goals. I ensured student success in meeting grade-level standards by using a variety of teaching methodologies, including Kod√°ly and First Steps in Music. Additionally, I designed age-appropriate curricula for six grade levels and managed grade-based data for approximately 500 students, maintaining accurate records to support student growth and achievement.
